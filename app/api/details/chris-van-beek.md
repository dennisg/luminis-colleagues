Technology enthousiast. Always wanting to learn more and tackle new challenges. I enjoy to give presentations / sessions about new technologies and teaching them to other people. I am especially enthousiastic about the .Net Technology stack.In the .Net stack I mainly focus on WPF, Windows Store Development and ASP.Net MVC on the client side. Also utilizing JQuery, Javascript and Knockout/Angular.js.As for the back-end, I mainly focus on SOAP, WCF, ASP.Net Web API, the SOA principles and RESTfull services.Next to the .Net framework I also have an interest in xml related technologies like, Xml, Xml Schema (1.1), XQuery and XSLT.On the process side of development I like to focus on SCRUM, RUP and agile methodologies.Lately I like to keep myself busy with Enterprise Architecture, Software architecture , systems integration and continous delivery.My job with Luminis Arnhem means that I get to bring all those skills together to build reliable quality software solutions.
