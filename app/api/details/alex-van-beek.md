I’m always keen to keep up with all the new and fancy technologies and I enjoy teaching those technologies to other people. I’m currently specialized in the following front-end technologies: 

- HTML(5)
- JavaScript(JQuery/BackBone.js/KnockOut.js)
- (Enterprise) Silverlight and mobile development: Android and Windows Phone. 

On the server-side I’m specialized in .Net related technologies: WCF/Service Oriented Architecture, Entity Framework and the ASP.Net Web Api. I am especially interested in Resource Oriented Architectures, the OData protocol and accompanying specifications as OAuth, Json Web Token and Json Web Encryption. I believe that these will be the future of server side development and will mark the end of the SOAP and WS-* era.

At Luminis Arnhem B.V. I work as a .Net Architect, creating modern and innovative solutions for our clients.
